# General Feedback on Assignment 4

I left some comments directly in your code and marked them with MR so that you
can find them quickly.

For future submissions please make sure to write your code a little bit nicer.
It is hard enough to work through code which I have not written myself and
inconsistent indentation does not help with this. Especially since any powerful
IDE should be able to handle this for you automatically.

I hope I answered the question from your mail with the comments I left in the
code. Otherwise let me know and I will try to be more specific.
